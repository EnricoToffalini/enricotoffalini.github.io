Whenever possible, slides, exercises, and code are freely accessible so that students, teachers, and researchers can reuse or adapt them.\n\n\n\n\nBasics of R for Data Science (PhD level) \n\n\n\nCourse website: https://enricotoffalini.github.io/Basics-R/\nShort description\nIntroductory, hands-on course on R for PhD students in Psychological Sciences. The focus is on using R as a practical tool for data handling, visualization, and basic statistical modeling, with a strong emphasis on reproducible workflows.\nWhat you can find here\n\n📑 Slides and lecture notes\n\nConceptual slides introducing R as a language for data science\n\nStep-by-step examples to reproduce directly in R / RStudio\n\n🧪 Hands-on exercises\n\nGuided exercises for getting familiar with R syntax, data structures, and basic plotting\n\nSmall data sets used in class, ready to be reused in other courses or self-study\n\n\nWho this is useful for\n\nPhD students and early-career researchers who need a compact, applied introduction to R\n\nTeachers who want ready-made R exercises and examples to integrate in their own courses\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasics of Python for Data Science (PhD level) \n\n\n\nCourse website: https://enricotoffalini.github.io/Basics-Python/\nShort description\nShort (10-hour) PhD-level introductory course on Python for data science, offered within the PhD in Psychological Sciences at the University of Padova. The idea is to give students who already use R a practical entry point into Python, with a focus on tools that R does not cover as easily.\nOpen materials available\n\n📑 Slides (fully open)\n\nIntro to This Course, aka Why We Should Use Python\n\nGetting Started: IDEs, Operations, Basic Types of Data\n\nVirtual Environments, Packages, Import/Export\n\nBasic Syntax, Typing, Indexing, Differences with R\n\nBasics of Data Science: Intro to NumPy and pandas\n\nProgramming: Conditionals, Loops, Custom Functions\n\n🧪 Exercises and tutorials\n\nFirst steps in Python and in NumPy / pandas\n\nProgramming exercises that mix control flow with real data tasks\n\nExtended exercises on:\n\nClustering and simulation of clusters\n\nSentiment analysis with Hugging Face transformers\n\nText embeddings, PCA, clustering, and simple text classification\n\nExamples of language, speech, and image processing\n\nA mini-tutorial on using AI / LLMs as research assistants in systematic reviews\n\n\n💻 Code and reproducible material All materials are hosted publicly on GitHub and are designed so that students can adapt scripts and notebooks to their own research problems\n\nWho this is useful for\n\nPhD students who already know R and want a practical bridge to Python\n\nInstructors who want ready-to-use, research-oriented Python notebooks for data science, NLP, and ML\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Psychology (MOOC on Federica Web Learning) \n\n\n\nCourse page (free registration required): https://lms.federica.eu/course/view.php?id=889\nShort description\nOnline course in General Psychology hosted on Federica Web Learning. The MOOC covers most core topics of general psychology and is taught in English.\nIn this course, my modules focus on:\n\nMethodology of research\n\nLearning and conditioning\n\nMemory\n\nLanguage and thought\n\nMotivation\n\nIntelligence\n\nWithin the same MOOC, another professor covers:\n\nHistory of psychology\n\nPerception\n\nTime perception\n\nAttention\n\nEmotion\n\nPersonality\n\nWhat you find in the course\n\n🎥 Video lectures with concise explanations and examples\n\n📝 Self-assessment quizzes to monitor understanding\n\n📚 Supplementary materials, such as short texts or reading suggestions linked to modules\n\nHow this can be useful\n\nAs a fully online, self-paced introduction to general psychology in English\n\nAs support for university courses in General Psychology\n\nAs a structured revision tool for students and professionals\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPsicologia dell’Intelligenza Umana \n\n\n\nSito del progetto e del corso IN COSTRUZIONE: https://enricotoffalini.github.io/psicologia-intelligenza\nChe cos’è questo progetto\nQuesto sito è un libro online in costruzione e, allo stesso tempo, uno spazio che raccoglie materiali didattici e divulgativi sulla psicologia dell’intelligenza umana, pensato per:\n\nstudentesse e studenti universitari\n\npsicologhe e psicologi che usano test cognitivi nella pratica\n\nchiunque voglia capire meglio cosa significhi “essere intelligenti”\n\nContenuti principali\n\n📘 Capitoli tematici\n\nStoria e teorie classiche e contemporanee dell’intelligenza\n\nBasi biologiche e genetiche delle differenze individuali\n\nMisurazione psicometrica, QI, e principali test cognitivi\n\nFenomeni sociali e culturali legati all’intelligenza\n\n💥 Temi avanzati e critici\n\nNeurodiversità, plusdotazione, funzionamento intellettivo limite e disabilità\n\nInterpretazione dei punteggi, limiti dei test, rischi di uso superficiale dei risultati\n\n💬 Divulgazione\n\nSezioni come Domande & Risposte e brevi approfondimenti su temi specifici\n\nAd esempio, una pagina dedicata all’Effetto Flynn e alla variazione del QI nel tempo\n\n\nA chi potrà servire\n\nStudenti e studentesse di corsi di Psicologia dell’Intelligenza e affini\n\nProfessionisti che desiderano una base teorica solida per interpretare i test cognitivi\n\nDocenti che cercano materiale aperto in italiano su intelligenza, QI e misurazione\n\n\n\n\n\n\n✅ You are welcome to link to these course pages, embed specific exercises in your own syllabi, or recommend them to students.\n\n✅ Slides and code examples are generally fine to reuse for non-commercial teaching, ideally with a short acknowledgement (but for the MOOC on Federica Web Learning, please refer to the Federica license before copying any part!).\n\n❓ If you plan a more extensive reuse (for example, translating large parts of material, or integrating them into a paid course), it’s generally fine, but please get in touch first.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in using or adapting these materials for your course, or if you have suggestions for improvements: enrico.toffalini@unipd.it\nI am always happy to see these resources reused, remixed, and improved, especially when they help promote better methods and critical thinking in psychological science."
